###  Description

Provides a unique, up-to-date survey of twelve Germanic languages from English
and German to Faroese and Yiddish.

###  Reviews

**'** _The Germanic Languages_ **is a comprehensive survey of Germanic
languages characterized by conciseness and lucidity. The way the languages are
treated in this edition as well as its editorial organization make it a
recommendable reference book for students of the Germanic philology as well as
a useful source of information for linguistics dealing either with comparative
or historical linguistics.'** \- _International Review of Applied Linguistics_

**'Both the authors and the editors have done a excellent job. It provides a
valuable basis for further comparative studies across the distinctly and yet
differently related Germanic group of languages.'** \- _Studies in Language_

**'An index, maps and tables/figures advance the seminal nature of** _The
Germanic Languages_ **for the study and research of general, Germanic, and
Indo-European linguistics.'** \- _Irmengard Rauch, Besprechungen_

###  About the Series

####  [ Routledge Language Family Series ](/series/SE0091 "View all books in
'Routledge Language Family Series'")

Each volume in this series contains an in-depth account of the members of some
of the world's most important language families. Written by experts in each
language, these accessible accounts provide detailed linguistic analysis and
description. The contents are carefully structured to cover the natural system
of classification: phonology, morphology, syntax, lexis, semantics,
dialectology, and sociolinguistics.  
  
Every volume contains extensive bibliographies for each language, a detailed
index and tables, and maps and examples from the languages to demonstrate the
linguistic features being described. The consistent format allows comparative
study, not only between the languages in each volume, but also across all the
volumes in the series.
